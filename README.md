Go for It Token Contract
==============

The token contract implements an ERC20 standard token.
It is named "Goin Token".
The ticker symbol will be GOI.
The number of decimals will be 18 to keep the resolution identical to ETH.
We rely on the broadly trusted Open Zeppelin v2.3.0 implementation of an ERC20 compliant Token.
